<h1>How to build by using cmake</h1>

<ul>
<li>You can build Tera Term by using <a href="https://cmake.org/">cmake</a>(EXPERIMENTAL).</li>
</ul>

<h2>cmake version</h2>

<ul>

<li>When the cmake option is selected on Visual Studio 2017 installer, the cmake can be installed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>MinGW (very experimental)</h2>

<ul>
<li>You can create the binary file by using MinGW.</li>
<li>EXPERIMENTAL</li>
<li>The ttpmacro.exe can not be built with MinGW.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to build library</h2>

<ul>
<li>You can prepare libraries used by Tera Term.</li>
<li>Refer to <code>lib/build_library_with_cmake.md</code>. </li>
<li>Refet to <code>develop.txt</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to build Tera Term</h2>

<p>Please execute below commands on the top of source tree.</p>

<pre><code>mkdir build_vs2005
cd build_vs2005
..\libs\cmake-3.11.4-win32-x86\bin\cmake.exe .. -G "Visual Studio 8 2005"
..\libs\cmake-3.11.4-win32-x86\bin\cmake.exe --build . --config release
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Change a string after <code>-G</code> option according to Visual Studio version.</li>
<li>The sln file is created, so the file can be opened with Visual Studio. </li>
<li>If the cmake is included in path, you need not write the full path of cmake.</li>
<li>When Visual Studio is launched by sln file and is building, the Visual Studio can re-generate the project file after detecting changes to CMakeLists.txt. So, the sln file is manually created only once.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to build Tera Term(MinGW)</h2>

<p>Please execute below commands on the top of source tree by using the cmake available on MinGW.</p>
