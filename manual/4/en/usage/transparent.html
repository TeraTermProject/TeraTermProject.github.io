<h1>Background transparency</h1>

<p>
Tera Term supports window background transparency. Now Tera Term has two types of transparency function. You can select either function. 
</p>

<h2>(1) AlphaBlend window</h2>

<p>
In this type Tera Term VT window can be background transparency. As a point that should be noted, this function is enabled on only Windows2000 later.<br>
You can configure the value in "Visual" tab on <a href="../menu/setup-additional.html">[Setup] Additional settings</a>.<br>
You can set up the value of transparency. The range of transparency is from 0 to 255. The more transparency reduces the value, the more window transparency is blinding. Default value is 255 (opaque).

<h2>(2) Eterm lookfeel window</h2>

<p>
In this type Tera Term window looks like Eterm background transparency. If this function, background of the client area (terminal part) of Tera Term VT window is changed.<br>
Please edit the "BGEnable=on" in the teraterm.ini file, or you can configure the value in "Visual" tab on <a href="../menu/setup-additional.html">[Setup] Additional settings</a>.
</p>

<p>
Please refer to "<a href="../setup/teraterm-win.html#eterm">Eterm lookfeel window</a>" for more detailed settings.
</p>


<h3>(2)-1 Mix theme file and background of Windows</h3>

<p>
Tera Term draws specified image in theme file in the termial background.<br />
Tera Term can mix a spacified image and Windows background image (wallpaper). This makes the window looks like semi-transparent.

<h2>(2)-2 Use an image</h2>

<p>
If image file is specified, Tera Term draws an image in the terminal background.<br />
In this mode Tera Term does not mix Windows background image (wallpaper). The window does not look like semi-transparent.<br />
(A theme file is created that is configured this behavior.)

<h2>(2)-3 Use background of Windows</h2>

<p>
When theme file is not used, Tera Term draws Windows background image (wallpaper) in the terminal background. This makes the window looks like semi-transparent.
