<h1>VT100 Wrap process</h1>

<p>
Normally, when outputting a single character,
following processes are performed:

<pre>
1. Output a character at current cursor position.
2. Move cursor position to next cell.
</pre>

When cursor is at the end of a line, If this behavior is applied,
result is as follows (When autowrap mode is enabled):

<pre>
1. Output a character at current cursor position.
2. If current cursor position is at the bottom (no next line), scroll one line to make blank line.
3. Moves cursor to the beginning of next line.
</pre>

<p>
Some terminals actually behave this way.
This behavior makes it difficult to output character at the lower right corner of the screen.

<p>
Therefore, when the cursor is at the end of a line, VT100 has the following character output behavior:

<pre>
1. Output characters at current cursor position (end of line).
2. Cursor position is unchanged at the end of the line.
</pre>

<p>
Output one character in this state:

<pre>
3. If current cursor position is at the bottom (no next line), scroll one line to make blank line.
4. Moves cursor to the beginning of next line.
5. Output a character at current cursor position.
6. Move cursor position to next cell.
</pre>

<p>
Delay automatic line break when outputting character following character at the end of the line.
