<h1>Unicode</h1>

<p>
To use UTF-8, changed from English to "UTF-8" or "Japanese" or "Korean" under Setup-&gt;General menu.<br>

<p>
When the Language "UTF-8" is selected, below function can not be used beside Japanese setting.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The JIS, EUC and SJIS character code except for UTF-8</li>
  <li>Specifying Japanese character set of ISO/IEC 2022</li>
  <li>TTXKanjiMenu plug-in</li>
</ul>

<p>

If you set the Language "Japanese" or "Korean", select "Terminal" from the Tera Term "Setup" menu. Inside the dialog-box,
select "UTF-8" from "Kanji(receive)" or "Kanji(transmit)".
There is no need to restart Tera Term to activate these configuration changes.<br>

When "UTF8" is specified with '/KT' or '/KR' option in the command line,
UTF-8 encoding/decoding can be used during transmitting and receiving of data.

<h1>Internal block diagram</h1>

<p>
  Before Tera Term 5, the character set of the internal buffer was DBCS (Double byte Character Set).
  For example, when "Language" is set to "Japanese", character coding in internal buffer was Shift_JIS.
</p>

<p>
  The character encoding of Tera Term 5 internal buffer is Unicode.
</p>

<p>
  The data flow is as follows.
